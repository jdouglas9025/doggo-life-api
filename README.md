# Doggo Life API
Doggo Life API is a REST API for a hypothetical social media app. It allows users to perform 
various operations (e.g., get posts from users I follow) through its endpoints. This is a 
backend app built using Java, Spring Boot, Cypher, and SQL. It uses a Neo4j graph database 
for relationships and recommendations, a MySQL database for posts, and AWS S3 for images.
